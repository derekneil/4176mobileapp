        <Cell><Data>In Canada, ALL operators of recreational powered watercraft must have proof of operator competency in order to operate any vessel. Proof of competency must be carried onboard the pleasure craft at all times while operating the craft. Failure to carry proof of competency can result in harsh monetary fines, which may be issued by any officer of the peace. Note: &quot;operate&quot; refers to the act of controlling the speed and course of a pleasure craft. PCOC Proof of competency can be a Pleasure Craft Operator Card, a Boating Safety Course Completion Card, a rental boat safety checklist, proof of successful completion of a boating safety course, or a training certificate recognized by Transport Canada. If carrying a Pleasure Craft Operator Card as proof of competency, the original card must be carried on board. Photocopies or other copies of the card will not be accepted as proof of competency. In the case of non-residents of Canada, they are required to have proof of operator competency if they operate their pleasure craft on Canadian waters for more than 44 consecutive days, or if they are operating a pleasure craft that is registered or licensed in Canada. An operator card that meets requirements in the non-residentâ€™s home state or country will be recognized as valid proof of competency in Canada. Note: For more information on additional proofs of competency that are recognized by Transport Canada, please visit www.boatingsafety.gc.ca, or call the Boating Safety Infoline at 1-800-267-6687.</Data></Cell>
