A prototype for the Ship-Fit application has been created and deployed for iPhone and iPad. With the exception of a few minor features, we were able to successfully implement the application that we set out to complete. The application incorporates numerous device features and provides the boater with the tools they need to enjoy their time out on the water. This report includes detailed functionality and justification for our application. As well as screen-shots and how we could improve the application in the future.
